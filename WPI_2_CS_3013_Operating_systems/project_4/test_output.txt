Clock eviction algorithm selected.

Testing threads (with 20 threads)
Now running at 10000.000 times normal speed, using clock algorithm

Non-thread related tests
Note that all times given below are relative to their time scales.
The theoretical times are based on the optimal page eviction algorithm.

Now running at 10000.000 times normal speed, using clock algorithm
	Testing simple allocation; it should finish in negligible time
	It actually took 0.030000 seconds
	Testing swapping to ssd; it should take at least 0.5 seconds
	It actually took 5.590000 seconds
	Testing swapping to disk; it should take at least 55.5 seconds
	It actually took 865.209981 seconds
	Testing maximum memory; it should take at least 2431.25 seconds
	It actually took 6573.209853 seconds
	Testing memory overflow; it should take at least 2431.25 seconds
	It actually took 6271.809860 seconds
	Testing allocation with locked RAM; it should finish in negligible time
	It actually took 0.140000 seconds
Now running at 1.000 times normal speed, using clock algorithm
	Tests freeing memory; it should finish in negligible time
	It actually took 0.000466 seconds
