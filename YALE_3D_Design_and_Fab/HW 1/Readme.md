# Readme:

All of the files related to the slicer is in the `simp_slice/` folder. Similarly all the files related to the squirrel is stored in the `Squirrel` directory. The summaries are a little to long to be comfortably fit into this file, so they are all in the `Paper summaries/` folder.

I had a quick conversation with Sherry about the nature of Triangle/plane intersections where I realized that if a segment is entirely in a plane, we can (mostly) ignore it because the two other line segments should intersect the plane anyway.
