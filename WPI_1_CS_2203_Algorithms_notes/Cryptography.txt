Crypto:

Codes aren't just ciphers: ASCII, AI32, & Morse are all codes

Cipher/cypher implies transformation of plaintext & secrets.

Cryptography:
	Starts with *plaintext*
	Encrypt with some *key*
		Produces *ciphertext*
	Later, decrypt with some key to get the plaintext.

Uses:
	Encryption
	Authentication


symmentric-key encryption:
	Same key in both directions
asymmetric-key encryption:
	Different keys for the two directions
		Could have public & private keys

Symmetric examples:
	Caesar cypher
		(Just shift each letter by n positions)
	Enigma machine
		(Rotating disks that changed every day)
	DES encryption
	

Public key cryptography
	AES, RSA
	
	2 keys: one public, one private
		Can encrypt with one & decrypt that message with the other.
	
	Alternate Authentication: (as opposed to simply encrypting with private key)
		Use a signature/hash/checksum/message-digest
			Just encrypt the checksum with the private key.
			(Much faster)
