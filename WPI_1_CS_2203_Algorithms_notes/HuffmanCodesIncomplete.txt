Huffman Codes:
	A way to compress strings of bytes using variable length encoding.
	
	Prefix codes are codes where no codeword is also a prefix of another codeword.
	
For Huffman Codes, we make a binary tree.
	Left child = 0
	Right child = 1
	
	
	Make a tree. The leaves are individual words (like a character), and the nodes above it have the sum of the frequencies of the leaves.
