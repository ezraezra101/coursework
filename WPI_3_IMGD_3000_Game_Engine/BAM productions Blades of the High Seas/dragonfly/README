## Platform:
Mac OSX (built on 10.10.5)
Using SFML 2.3 (installed by Homebrew)

## Code Structure:
All header files are in the "include" directory.
C++ source files are in the "src" directory.
The "obj" directory becomes populated with .o files during compilation.
"unit_tests" contains automatable unit tests' source.
"integration_tests" contains the source for tests that deal with multiple files/classes and/or require human input.

"unit_tests_exec" and "integration_tests_exec" contain the executables for their respective test types.

The Makefile, resulting archive file, and dragonfly log from testing are in the root directory.

## Notes:
View Objects are not currently working.

## How to compile:
Run `make`
Running `make tests` will build the tests, where `make run_tests`
