To build:

0) Setup development environment for MacOS.
See http://dragonfly.wpi.edu/ for details.
It's probably possible to use a different engine, but the currently included one is built for MacOS.

1) Go to the blades_of_the_high_seas directory. (`cd blades_of_the_high_seas`)

2) Run `make` This builds both the game and, if not yet built, the dragonfly engine.

3) Run `./game` to start the game

How to play:

The game is designed for two players, each controlling a different pirate.

A, or J: Moves your pirate to the left.
D, or L: Moves your pirate to the right.
W, or I: Makes your pirate jump. Pirates need a bit of time to make their jump, so make sure you have enough time!
E, or O: Your standard slash attack. Be careful not to get your hands slashed off!
R, or P: Fire your pistol! Skilled pirates can shoot other bullets out of the air, but be careful, you only have three!
ESC: Quit the game.
