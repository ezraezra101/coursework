Project ID:			Lab 3 - Command Line Arguements and Event List Operations
CS Class:			CS 2303
Programming Language:		C
OS/Hardware dependencies:	no significant dependencies

Problem Description:
	Create an event list (linked list) sorted by arrival time
	Also demonstrate removing the first element of the linked list.


How to build the program:	
	make
	make clean #remove .o files
	
How to run the program:
	Input by hand:
		./edavis_lab3 [source]
	Run test files:
		make test
	Build program, run test files, and clean up:
		make run

Program Source:
	add_event.c
	create_node.c
	get_nextevent.c
	lab3.h
	main.c
	print_eventList.c
	print_node.c
	
	Makefile

Additional Files:
	README
	lab3.dat		#test data
	lab3-2.dat		#more test data
	eventlist.txt	#results from the first test file
	eventlist-2.txt #results from the second test file
	
	edavis_lab3		#executable, created from building
	
	.o files are used in compiling the program and can be deleted on sight.

Results:	

Test Procedures:
	make run	# builds the program and runs a test using testData.txt
