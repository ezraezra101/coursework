			M1 & M2 are routers (Mule Nodes)
			
M1 & M2 both have FCFS queues

Professor Kinicki used a single eventlist for all the nodes

The sources are CONSTANTLY putting out new packets.
	The second source starts at time 3.

The sources produce packets.
	Packets have size
	
	Transmission time:
		How long it takes to put the packet onto the wire.
		 Its a function of the size of the packet and the transmission time.
	Propagation time:
		How long the packet takes to actually travel down the wire.
		
		

		
		
#If two events arrive at the same time, the one that is processed 2nd gets put in the back.
