Performance Metrics: (general definitions)

Utilization:
The percentage of time a device is busy servicing a "customer"
1 - idleTime (for CPUs)

Throughput:
The number of jobs processed by the "system" per unit time
(coming out of the processor/system)
JobsFinished/second

Response time:
The time required to receive a response to a request (round-trip time)

Delay:
The time to traverse from one end to the other in a system (not round-trip)



Round Robin queueing is designed to decrease the mean delay.

Input Load - input that goes to the queue

I(nput load) & G (input coming back from CPU) are called the offered load

a drop-tail queue is a queue that drops the last item of the queue if it gets too full.
