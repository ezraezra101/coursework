Pointers!!

& = get address
* = pointed to value

int i = 0;
&i //returns the address of the variable (unsigned int (sortof))

int *ptr = &i; //sets ptr to the address of i
//If you do this after initialization:
ptr = &i; //(don't ask)

*ptr //the same as writing i //called the indirection operator

&ptr //is the address of the *pointer*

int array[2] = {1} // creates array {1, 0}

int *arrPtr = array; //sets arrPtr to the address of array[0]

(arrPtr + 1) //pointer arithmatic is different. This is the address of array[1]


printf("%p", ptr); //prints the address pointed to in hexadecimal
