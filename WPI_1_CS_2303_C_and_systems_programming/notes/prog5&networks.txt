Concurrency
	OS has to deal with concurrency (virtual or actual)
	It can be something like: The CPU can be working on something at the same time as the I/O processor, or
	it can be something like Round Robin...
	

Communication


Source Routing




Multilevel Feed Back
	Multiple queues heading into the CPU
	One for shortest jobs, one for medium jobs ...
	The shortest job queue is serviced first.
	
	If something is sitting in the longest queue for a long time, it is moved into a higher priority queue.
			This can also be applied to networks
			
			
Source Routing allows the source to specify the routing of a packet. (as opposed to non-source routing, where the routers specifies the route)

Packets have a source.
A node's connection is established on first communication.
Packets know their route.
