    "Picked 330 infographics and showed 30 them for 500 ms, then repeated with the same 30. Still online at http://www.labinthewild.org\n",
    "##### Findings\n",
    "- What makes an infographic appealing?\n",
    "    - Positive correlation for colorfulness & appeal (p < 0.001)\n",
    "    - Females prefer less compleximages\n",
    "    - Older people prefered less complexity\n",
    "    - More education = less color, less complexity\n",

    "One proposal is keeping visualization history somehow (e.g. minimaps, purple links)\n",

    "- Addition (Add a new visual encoding e.g. heatmap in background...)\n",

    "###### Results\n",
    "- Average participants visits more sub-charts, and certainly more than the original average.\n",
    "- Hindsight encourages people to visit different parts of the data.\n",
    "- Slightly increases visit time\n",

    "##### What Prof. Lane did:\n",
    "Tried to figure out if stress (via Affective Priming) impacts ability to read charts.\n",
    "Notably, bar charts changed little, pie charts were more inaccurate when people were primed with sad news stories."
